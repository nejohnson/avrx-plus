   Notes

   Force a semaphore into the _PEND state.  This is almost identical
   to SetSemaphore, but the end state is always _PEND rather than,
   possibly _DONE.

   Usable in USER code only.

   It does not make sense to reset a semaphore that has
   a process waiting, so just skip that situation.

   Sem State            Transition
   ----------           ------------
   SEM_PEND             SEM_PEND        (already reset, waiting)
   SEM_DONE             SEM_PEND        (action)
   else                 no change       (active wait)

void AvrXResetSemaphore(pMutex mtx)
{
   _avrxBeginCritical();
   if ( *mtx == AVRX_SEM_DONE )
      *mtx = AVRX_SEM_PEND;
   _avrxEndCritical();
